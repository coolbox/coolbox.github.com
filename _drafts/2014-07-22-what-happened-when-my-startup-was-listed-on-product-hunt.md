title: What Happened When My Startup Was Listed On Product Hunt
---

I've built two products in the last few months that were both listed on [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com). [Sisu](http://madewithsisu.com/?utm_source=peteroome&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=petes-blog), picked up by [Grégoire Gilbert (@gregoiregilbert)](http://twitter.com/gregoiregilbert) and I was responsible for posting [Flipshop](http://flipshop.io/?utm_source=peteroome&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=petes-blog), after clearing it with the Product Hunt crew.

## What's Product Hunt?
Product Hunt is a community driven site. It provides a platform for a group of hand selected people to post products they find on the Internet and think are cool. The Product Hunt community up-vote the products they agree are cool and provide feedback to the founders along the way.

As an entrepreneur, seeing your product listed on Product Hunt is a pretty big deal, right now. There are a lot of benefits, but there are some pitfalls too that you should be aware of.

A few things that have sprung to mind…

## Wow!! We got listed on Product Hunt…
A few of the benefits we've experienced:

* **Exposure**  
The exposure we've received has been great. In both cases, on the day of listing, thousands of people visited each website. This is by far, one of the quickest ways to get your product and brand seen and talked about.

* **Feedback**  
The Product Hunt community are extremely supportive. We've received some great feedback from both technical and business people alike. Some of the feedback was inline with our own development plans, some of it was stuff we hadn't even thought of. This was helpful and propelled us towards validating the assumptions surrounding our products.

* **Validation**  
We cross-referenced feedback from Product Hunt with our own assumptions to determine if we were on the right path.
  * Are these users buying/downloading the product?
  * Have we built what they want? Are they using it?
  * What features do they want to see next?
  * Why didn't they complete their order?  

  Collecting a bunch of data on these points has helped us to get answers to our assumptions.

* **Users & Paying Customers**  
We've acquired lots of users and paying customers. Sisu received in the region of 1k new users. Flipshop although receiving a good deal of traffic to it's desktop site, only saw 20 or so downloads from the App Store. Either way, we collected users.

* **More Exposure**  
Weeks after Sisu's listing on Product Hunt, we stumbled across a link to the site again, in one of the daily emails sent out to the community. Linked in a curated list of "Geeky, Artsy Products For Your Home", Sisu saw another peak in bonus traffic.

* **Weakness**  
If there is one thing that a spike (or multiple spikes) in traffic will help you to test, it's the resilience of your systems. Silly mistakes and bugs in your signup or checkout process are highlighted and amplified. Fix them and get back to marketing. It's better to find these problems now before you get picked up by Techcrunch and Mashable.

## Wait, Look Out For Those Pitfalls!
There are some pitfalls associated with seeing your product listed on Product Hunt…

* **Wrong Audience**  
Remember who your target audience is/was in the first place. Do the people who visit Product Hunt match the profile of your intended user? This has a huge bearing on how you should interpret comments. Which brings me onto Feedback again…

* **Feedback**  
In the most part, those early adopters who took the time to feedback on our products, matched our intended audience. However, quite often this won't be the case. Before diving in with "that's a great idea" and implementing said request, take a second to think about who the feedback came from and what their use case for your product is. Do they just like hanging out on Product Hunt to try out new products and talk to founders or is your product genuinely solving a problem for them?

* **Spikes**  
Don't be fooled by the overwhelming (for an MVP anyway) amount of traffic you'll receive * it doesn't last. The spike you'll witness will last for 24-36 hours tops, and then it's gone. The traffic can provide some wonderful opportunities and some false hope. False hope that your marketing work is done here. Wrong. There is a lot (A LOT) of work still to be done if your going to be a success. This is just the first rung of the ladder…

Generally, the experience of getting listed on Product Hunt has been excellent. We're over the moon with the feedback we've collected, the users we've acquired, and the results we’ve seen. The community is rich with experience. They've provided us with some fantastic insight and knowledge. But it's also important to remember your own experience and insight, as well as the data you've collected up until this point. Cross reference everything. Avoid the pitfalls. Make smart, informed decisions about the direction of your shiny new startup!
