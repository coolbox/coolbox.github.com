title: Flight Mode for Mac
---

Having pulled out my laptop, whilst sat on a flight to NY, it occurred to me that there should be a flight mode for laptops (if this doesn't already exist?!).

It's simpleâ€¦

- Turn off wifi
- Turn off Bluetooth
- Save battery

The save battery one is where some customisation may come in:

- Kill non-essential running software.  
*e.g software that depends on an Internet connection. Examples on my machine include:  Buffer for Mac, Google Drive, Shazam. Ask to Save before closing!*

- Reduce brightness.  
*Brightness level to be determined in Preferences by user.*

## Form

- Menu Bar App activated by a single click.

## Bonus

- Remember pre-flight mode status.  

*Restore whatever software the user was running and what settings they had prior to switching to flight-mode.*

## Name Ideas

- FLIM
- Lofty
- High
- Lift-Off
