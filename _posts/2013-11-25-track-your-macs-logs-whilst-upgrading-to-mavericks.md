title: Track your Mac's logs whilst upgrading to Mavericks
---

I was installing the latest OSX upgrade, Mavericks, the other day when my little Macbook Air seemed to be hanging. Normally i don't worry about these things. I've not had any fatal problems when upgrading an OS before, touch wood - so i had no reason to worry. However, at this point i'd been out to lunch, sat catching up with news on my phone and about 2 hours had passed since i started the upgrade.

Given, the installed suggested it would take under an hour to complete i started to wonder if something bad was happening. Taking to Twitter i asked if anyone else had experienced long install times for Mavericks. It took about 30 seconds before i received a very useful response in return.

## Track Your Mac's Logs
It turn's out that: `command+L` or `command+3` will open and show you you're machine's logs whilst the update is taking place, that way you can be sure your computer isn't 'hanging' and prevent any kind of futher panicking! :-)
