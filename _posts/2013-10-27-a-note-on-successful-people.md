title: A note about successful people
---

Since moving to London 6 weeks ago, I've been attending a lot of meetups, networking events and conferences; everything from [Silicon Drinkabout](http://silicondrinkabout.com/london "Silicon Drinkabout") to [WXG](http://wxg.co.uk/ "Web Expo Guildford") last week in Guildford. And there is one thing that stands out head and shoulders above anything else i've taken away from these eventsâ€¦

The people who i recognise as being successful and have achieved impressive things are the ones who are the most forthcoming with help and support:

* They're the first to offer feedback about what we're working on.

* They're the first to email back giving advice.

* And they're the first to offer their help in the firstplace.

This has surprised me somewhat but it also puts a massive smile on my face.

__Lesson learnt:__ Be as helpful as possible, whenever possible because it eventually comes back to you tenfold.
